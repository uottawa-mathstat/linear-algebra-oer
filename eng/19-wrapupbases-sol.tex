\begin{sol}{prob17.1} Extend the given linearly independent set of $\R^n$ to a basis of $\R^n$.  (Use your work  from question 1 where useful.)

(b) $\set{(1, 0,1), (0,1,1)}$ ($\R^3$)

\soln Since $\dim \R^3=3$ and we already have 2 linearly independent vectors, we only need to find $w\in \R^3$ such that $\rank \bmatrix 1& 0&1\\
0&1&1\\&w\endbmatrix=3.$ Clearly, $w=(0,0,1)$ will do, since then $\bmatrix 1& 0&1\\
0&1&1\\&w\endbmatrix$ is in RRE form and its rank is clearly 3 
\medskip

(d) $\set{(1, 0, 1, 3)}$ ($\R^4$)

\soln Since  $\dim \R^4=4$ and we only have 1 linearly independent vector, we  need to find $u,v,w\in \R^4$ such that $\rank \bmatrix 1&0&1&3\\
&u\\ &v\\&w\endbmatrix=4.$ Clearly, $u=(0,1,0,0), v=(0,0,1,0)$ and $w=(0,0,0,1)$ will suffice, since then $\bmatrix 1&0&1&3\\
&u\\ &v\\&w\endbmatrix$ is in RRE form and its rank is clearly 4.
