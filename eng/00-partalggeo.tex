\part{Algebra and Geometry}
\noindent  
A major theme of linear algebra is how to generalize ideas in geometry to 
higher dimensions, by interpreting geometric ideas algebraically.  At the same time, one finds that thinking about an algebraic problem geometrically gives
insights into the algebra.  

We begin our exploration of these themes with a study of the complex numbers, and then a review of some high school geometry (with an eye to extending some of ideas there to higher dimensions).
