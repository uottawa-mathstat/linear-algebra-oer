\chapter*{Acknowledgments -- English Edition}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}

The authors would like to thank those who helped in the making of this book, even though they were completely unaware of it. Our book grew out of our lecture notes for a first year course at the University of Ottawa over a long period, during which time we were guided by  several well-known, excellent and comprehensive texts by authors including Howard Anton, W. Keith Nicholson, David C. Lay, and Seymour Lipschutz and Marc Lipson. Over the years, we also consulted texts by Tom M. Apostol, Otto Brestcher, and Gilbert Strang.



We readily extend our gratitude to colleagues who found the inevitable errors and typos in the first edition. Principally, we thank Anne Broadbent, Saeid Molladavoudi, and Charles Starling who sent us embarassingly long lists of typos and errors as well as many excellent suggestions for changes. 

The book was first used as a text here in the Fall of 2015, and we offer our thanks to the dozens of students in MAT1341 who read our book, found our mistakes and were kind enough to let us know.

That being said, those errors or typos that remain are entirely due to the authors!
