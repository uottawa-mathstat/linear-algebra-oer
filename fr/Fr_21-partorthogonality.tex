\begin{partbacktext}
\part{Orthogonality}
\noindent  We now return to some geometric ideas that we haven't touched on since defining abstract vector spaces.  Although we only specifically work with the dot product of vectors in $\R^n$ in the following chapters, everything that is covered is applicable to any finite dimensional vector space equipped with an inner product.
